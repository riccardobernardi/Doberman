# MonitoringAndUpload
 A watchdog tool that uploads the modifications of local files to a remote server.
 It is very simple it needs only to have:
- one local directory to be watched
- one remote directory that you would like to sync with the local one
- password and ip of the server



Compatibility:

- MacOs -> natively
- Linux -> natively
- WinOs -> we don't like it but if you install Ubuntu subsystem it will hopefully work:)



[RUN] To run the tool enter the directory of this app with the command:

```bash
cd /Users/...fill with the actual path here.../MonitoringAndUpload
```

[RUN] Then type this:

```bash
python3 main.py directory_to_watch_path username password server_ip remote_directory
```
